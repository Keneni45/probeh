# Chapter 1: Introduction to Photoshop

### What is Photoshop?

Adobe Photoshop is a powerful and popular image editing software that is used by professionals and hobbyists alike. It is a raster graphics editor, meaning it works with pixels to create and manipulate images. With Photoshop, you can do everything from basic photo retouching to creating complex digital paintings and illustrations.

### Understanding the Workspace

When you first open Photoshop, you'll be greeted by the workspace. It can seem overwhelming at first, but it's organized logically to help you find the tools you need.

*   **The Menu Bar:** Located at the very top of the screen, the Menu Bar contains menus for file operations, editing, image adjustments, layers, and more.
*   **The Options Bar:** Below the Menu Bar, the Options Bar displays options for the currently selected tool.
*   **The Tools Panel:** Typically on the left side of the screen, the Tools Panel contains all the tools you'll use to edit images, such as the Brush Tool, the Move Tool, and the Selection Tools.
*   **The Panels:** On the right side of the screen, you'll find various panels that provide more options and controls. Some of the most important panels include the Layers panel, the Color panel, and the History panel.
*   **The Document Window:** This is the main area where you'll work on your image.

### Opening and Creating New Documents

There are two main ways to start working in Photoshop:

*   **Opening an Existing Image:** To open an existing image, go to `File > Open` and select the image file from your computer. Photoshop supports a wide variety of file formats, including JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF.
*   **Creating a New Document:** To create a new, blank document, go to `File > New`. This will open the New Document dialog box, where you can specify the dimensions, resolution, color mode, and background content for your new document.
