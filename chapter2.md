# Chapter 2: Basic Image Editing

### Cropping and Resizing Images

*   **Cropping:** The Crop Tool allows you to remove unwanted parts of an image. Select the Crop Tool from the Tools Panel, then click and drag to create a cropping border. You can adjust the border by dragging the handles, and then press Enter to apply the crop.
*   **Resizing:** To resize an image, go to `Image > Image Size`. In the Image Size dialog box, you can change the dimensions (width and height) and the resolution of the image. It's important to be aware that increasing the size of an image can result in a loss of quality.

### Adjusting Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are two of the most basic image adjustments.

*   **Brightness:** Brightness refers to the overall lightness or darkness of an image.
*   **Contrast:** Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of an image.

You can adjust brightness and contrast using the `Brightness/Contrast` adjustment layer. Go to `Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Brightness/Contrast`. This will create a new layer that allows you to adjust the brightness and contrast non-destructively, meaning you can always go back and change the settings later.

### Working with Colors

Photoshop provides many tools for working with colors.

*   **Hue/Saturation:** The `Hue/Saturation` adjustment layer (`Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Hue/Saturation`) is a powerful tool for adjusting the colors in your image.
    *   **Hue:** Hue refers to the pure color (e.g., red, green, blue). You can use the Hue slider to shift all the colors in your image.
    *   **Saturation:** Saturation is the intensity of a color. Increasing the saturation makes the colors more vibrant, while decreasing it makes them more muted.
    *   **Lightness:** Lightness controls the overall brightness of the colors.
*   **Color Balance:** The `Color Balance` adjustment layer (`Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Color Balance`) allows you to make more subtle color adjustments by adding or subtracting colors from the shadows, midtones, and highlights of your image.
